I'm an experienced **Application and Solutions Developer / Architect / Consultant** specializing in Cloud, Mobile, and everything related. With extensive knowledge and over **20 years of experience**, I've been building software for multiple platforms and form factors, from devices to cloud and everything in between.

### Professional Focus

As a **[Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/e343a429-7b0d-ed11-b83f-000d3a1036b3)**, I focus on creating developer tools and solutions that enhance productivity and simplify complex development workflows. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle - from design and development to testing, deployment, monitoring, and instrumentation of systems ranging from small projects to large-scale commercial, industrial, and enterprise applications.

### Technology Stack & Platforms

I've built software that runs across diverse environments:

- **Cloud**: Azure, serverless architectures
- **Desktop**: Windows Servers, Windows Desktop, Windows Embedded, Windows CE, Mac OS, Unix, Linux
- **Mobile**: iOS, Android, Xamarin
- **Web**: Wide range of browsers, ASP.NET Core, REST APIs
- **Modern Tech**: .NET 9.0, OpenAPI/Swagger, microservices, event sourcing, CQRS

### Open Source

I'm passionate about building developer tools and maintaining several popular open source projects:

- **[Refitter](https://github.com/christianhelle/refitter)** - A tool for generating Refit interfaces and contracts from OpenAPI specifications, making REST API consumption in .NET seamless and type-safe.

- **[REST API Client Code Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/apiclientcodegen)** - A comprehensive Visual Studio extension supporting multiple code generators (AutoRest, NSwag, OpenAPI Generator, Kiota) for generating REST API clients from OpenAPI specifications.

- **[HTTP File Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/httpgenerator)** - Generate .http files from OpenAPI specifications for testing APIs directly in your IDE.

- **[SQL Compact Query Analyzer](https://github.com/christianhelle/sqlcequery)** - A fast and lightweight tool for querying and manipulating SQL CE databases, supporting versions 3.0 through 4.0.

- **[cURL Request Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/curlgenerator)** - Generate cURL requests from OpenAPI specifications, perfect for API testing and documentation.

- **[AutoFaker](https://github.com/christianhelle/autofaker)** - A Python library designed to minimize the setup/arrange phase of your unit tests by automatically generating fake data.

- **[JMeter Test Plan Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/jmetercodegen)** - Generate Apache JMeter test plans from OpenAPI specifications for load testing and performance validation.

- **[ResW File Code Generator](https://github.com/christianhelle/reswcodegen)** - Visual Studio custom tool for generating strongly-typed classes from ResW resource files, supporting Visual Studio 2015-2022.

- **[Multi Document Reader for OpenAPI.NET](https://github.com/christianhelle/oasreader)** - OpenAPI reader that merges external references into a single document using the Microsoft OpenAPI toolset.

- **[SQLite Query Analyzer](https://github.com/christianhelle/sqlitequery)** - A modern, cross-platform SQLite database management tool built with C++ and Qt, recently updated after a decade.

- **[Azure DevOps CLI](https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli)** - Command-line interface for Azure DevOps operations, streamlining CI/CD workflows and project management.

- **[HTTP File Runner](https://github.com/christianhelle/httprunner)** - A fast, small, single binary tool for running .http files from the command line, built with Zig for optimal performance.

### Knowledge Sharing

I actively share knowledge through my blog, covering topics like:

- **OpenAPI & API Development**: Tools and best practices for API-first development
- **Developer Productivity**: Creating tools that streamline development workflows  
- **Azure & Cloud Technologies**: Authentication, microservices, and modern application patterns
- **Visual Studio Extensions**: Building tools that enhance the development experience
- **Testing & Quality**: Modern approaches to API testing and validation

Recent popular posts include Azure Entra ID authentication with Scalar, testing Refit interfaces, and generating development assets from OpenAPI specifications.

### Organizations & Community

I contribute to and collaborate with various organizations:

- **Microsoft MVP** - Recognition for community contributions
- **GitHub Developer Program Member**
- Active contributor to **.NET ecosystem** projects
- Member of multiple development communities focused on API development and tooling

### Current Interests

I'm currently exploring:

- **Rust** - Systems programming and performance-focused development
- **Zig** - Modern systems programming language
- **Go** - Cloud-native and distributed systems development
- **Modern API Standards** - OpenAPI 3.x, AsyncAPI, and emerging API technologies
