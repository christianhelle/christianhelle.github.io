My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle - from design and development to testing, deployment, monitoring, and instrumentation of systems ranging from small projects to large-scale commercial, industrial, and enterprise applications.

### Technology Stack & Platforms

I've built software that runs across diverse environments:

- **Cloud**: Azure, serverless architectures

### Open Source

Open source is a core part of my professional identity and passion. I am dedicated to building and sharing developer tools that help others solve real-world problems, improve productivity, and adopt modern development practices. My efforts focus on creating high-quality, well-documented, and actively maintained projects that support the .NET ecosystem, API development, testing, and automation. I believe in the power of community-driven software and regularly contribute to and maintain a variety of open source initiatives.
