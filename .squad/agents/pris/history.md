# Pris — History

## Core Context
- Project: christianhelle/blog — Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages
- User: Christian Helle
- Theme: Custom Minima fork with dark skin (https://github.com/christianhelle/minima)
- Layouts: `_layouts/`, Includes: `_includes/`, Assets: `assets/`
- Ruby deps managed with Bundler (`Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`)
- Plugins in `_plugins/`
- Test changes locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental`
- Never break the dark theme — it's central to the site identity

## Team Updates (2026-03-06)

**Pris (UI/Layout Dev):** Completed share button X rebrand. Replaced Twitter bird SVG with X icon glyph. Updated accessible label and title to "Share on X". Preserved existing `twitter.com/intent/tweet` endpoint and Liquid parameters. Jekyll build passed, visual validation passed on representative post page.

**Roy (Test & Infra):** Added focused Playwright regression coverage in `ShareUiTests.cs` for share UI protection. Hardened archive test infrastructure by applying `Exact = true` to link role locators, preventing substring-match collisions on title prefixes. Pre-existing unrelated timeout remains in `Crawl_Archive` at Source Code Download step (not caused by share rebrand work).

**Rachael (Content Dev):** Completed projects page refresh with 4 new repositories. Strong Zig presence in updates (3 of 4 projects): Argiope web crawler, CLOCZ line counter, and Azure SDK for Zig. Otaku (manga reader) adds portfolio diversity. All existing projects preserved. Selection emphasized non-forks, active repos, creator-maintained, meaningful descriptions. Portfolio positioning emphasizes practical developer value.
