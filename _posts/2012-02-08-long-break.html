As I come back from another long blogging break, a&nbsp;lot of great things have happened in my life...<br /><br />The greatest experience I've had so far in my life was&nbsp;on September 15, 2011 I became a father to this wonderfully charming little guy you see below: <br /><br /><img alt="" aria-busy="false" aria-describedby="fbPhotosSnowboxCaption" class="spotlight" height="424" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18352048/Photos/331429_10150560003022904_1823838078_o.jpg" width="640" /><br /><br />I took a full month off work to play daddy and to assist my wife with everything I possibly can. It was a great time and I'll never regret or forget that.<br /><br />My hands were completely tied from work the day I got back from my leave. Luckily the projects were all very exciting and challenging, but did require me to spend a ton of hours on work. I had the chance to work on an online music service called TDC Play&nbsp;for a rather large danish based telecom company called TDC. I unfortunately only took part in the design and development of the Windows Phone 7 version, but the app is also available on the iOS and Android.<br /><br />You can check out the app here:<br /><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/da-DK/apps/01f8e8d3-d7aa-4bf6-9dcd-38e556c81ee3">http://www.windowsphone.com/da-DK/apps/01f8e8d3-d7aa-4bf6-9dcd-38e556c81ee3</a><br />...unfortunately, due to infrastructure and licensing issues it's only available to Danish customers<br /><br />The app was extremely fun to make and I got the to work with my old colleages from the Microsoft Development Center in Copenhagen. I expect to post some articles on performance, background agents, Implementing a MediaStreamSource for streaming or progressive downloads, and loads of other fun stuff.<br /><br />I also got started again in doing some speaking events. In February 29 in Horsons, Denmark I'll be doing a talk on <a href="http://www.danishdevconf.com/speakers/christian-helle/">Windows Phone 7 and HTML5</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href="http://danishdevconf.com/">Danish Developer Conference</a>&nbsp;and on February 13 I'll be doing an online talk on <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2786639915">Background Agents on Windows Phone 7</a><br /><br />So what's next for me in the blogsphere? Well to begin with I'd like to continue on my series Multi-platform Mobile Development and some articles on Windows Phone 7 development. I'm looking forward to getting back into writing some useful articles.<br /><br />I'll probably also be back on the MSDN forums, especially the Smart Device section to help out other developers running into issues with mobile development
