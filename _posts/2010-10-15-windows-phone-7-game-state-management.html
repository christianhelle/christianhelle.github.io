Not so long ago I wrote a Puzzle game for Windows Phone 7 using XNA. The game was really simple and had no menu or state management. Luckily, I recently stumbled upon a sample on MSDN that describes the basics of implementing game state management using XNA.<br /><br />To try things out a bit more I modified my existing puzzle game and included the sample game state management code. The results are pretty amazing!<br /><br />Here's how my Puzzle Game for Windows Phone 7 looks like now:<br /><br /><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CjmIzRYPlUs?fs=1&amp;hl=da_DK"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CjmIzRYPlUs?fs=1&amp;hl=da_DK" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />If you're getting into writing games for Windows Phone 7 using XNA then you should really check out the Game State Management sample here:<br /><a href="http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management">http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management</a><br /><br />I described in detail how I built my puzzle game application in an article called <a href="http://christian-helle.blogspot.com/2010/09/writing-puzzle-game-for-windows-phone-7.html">Writing a Puzzle Game for Windows Phone 7 using XNA</a>.
