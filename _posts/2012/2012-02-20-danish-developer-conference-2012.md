There's a lot of talks about HTML5 these days and I myself will be doing a talk regarding the subject in the Danish Developer Conference. I was planning on saving my content for my presentation but once my talk is done I'll be posting a couple of articles on HTML5 and Windows Phone 7.  

Here's an introduction / teaser to what I'll be presenting...
