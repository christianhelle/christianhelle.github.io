Once again I have taken a break from blogging. Parenting and my new family has been my absolute top priority and I've been having a hard time finding the time to write articles. I really enjoy spending time with my son and wife and I take advantage of every possible moment to do so.<br /><br />I ended up at a schedule that starts around 5:30 AM in which my son wakes up, and wakes me up. I go and start preparing some breakfast for him. We then have a cozy morning playing around the house. I drop him off at day care as late possible (in my case 9:00 AM) and then drive to the office, or to a customer, or back home if I'm working from home. I pick my son up at between 3:00-4:00 PM and spend time with him and my wife until around 6:30 PM (this is his bed time and I'm very lucky that he has no trouble sleeping). From around 6:30 to 8:00-9:00 PM I spend some time with my wife discussing how our days went and do some planning for the following days. My wife goes to bed a bit early, and when that happens I go back to work. Since I drastically shortened by day, I need to do quite a bit of catching up at night. I usually work an extra 2-3 hours more at night, then I have an hour or 2 to give my mind a rest or work on a hobby project. My day usually ends between 12:30 AM and 2:00 AM. I need at least 4 hours of sleep to recharge for the next day, otherwise I won't be able to last a full week on my schedule.<br /><br />Hence the break from blogging :)
