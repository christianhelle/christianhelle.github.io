If are not pleased with the emulator that shipped with the Windows Phone 7 developer tools then here's a quick way to replace the trimmed down emulator with the full version<br /><br />1) Create a back up of your current emulator image file, to avoid re-installing the developer tools if in case anything goes wrong. This file will be under <span style="font-weight:bold;">[PROGRAM FILES (x86)]\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.0\Emulator\Images\</span> and is called <span style="font-weight:bold;">WM70C1.en-US.bin</span><br /><br />2) Find and download an unlocked image in your search engine of choice, search for <span style="font-weight:bold;">WM70C1.en-US.unlocked</span> :)<br /><br />3) Once downloaded, Copy the unlocked emulator image to <span style="font-weight:bold;">[PROGRAM FILES (x86)]\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.0\Emulation\Images\</span><br /><br />4) Rename the unlocked emulator image to <span style="font-weight:bold;">WM70C1.en-US.bin</span><br /><br />5) Run the emulator :)<br /><br />If all goes well you should be able to run the unlocked emulator and it should look like this:<br /><br /><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KLBY1h1o6ds?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/KLBY1h1o6ds?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><br /><br />I would advise to make sure that you can deploy and debug applications with Visual Studio. If not then you probably found an older version of the unlocked emulator image and you should try to search again for a newer version.
