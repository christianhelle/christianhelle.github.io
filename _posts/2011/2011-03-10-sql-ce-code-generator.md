More than a year ago, I published a project on CodePlex called [SQL Compact Code Generator](http://github.com/christianhelle/sqlcecodegen). Unfortunately, I never managed to find the time to do some work on it and the project was set on a very long hold. A year after I suddenly really needed such a tool and decided that I should put in some hours on the project.  

I'm currently working on a large enterprise project where changes to the database schema is done rather frequently, to avoid the pain of updating my data layer after every change I decided to use my code generator.  

Here's some details I pulled directly off the ~~CodePlex~~ [Github](http://github.com/christianhelle/sqlcecodegen) page.

### Project Description
