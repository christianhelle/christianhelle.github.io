About a year ago, I had the chance to sit down with a brilliant developer with Muscular Atrophy. I was doing some mentoring that time and was helping them in solving some minor issues regarding a Windows Mobile based solution.  
  
Yesterday, while I was checking out what's new on MSDN's Channel 9 website I saw that the guys at Cepa Mobility were interviewed by Channel 9. These guys are doing some really great stuff for enabling people with disabilities.  
  
Here are some very interesting and inspiring videos of the guys and their work:
