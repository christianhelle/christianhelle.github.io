I've published a few articles and quite a deal of code in my blog. I realized that I never properly published the source code as Visual Studio solutions.<br /><br />I will upload all source code as Visual Studio solutions to this URL:<br /><a href="http://cid-ca531e7fb4762c70.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Code%20Samples">http://cid-ca531e7fb4762c70.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Code%20Samples</a><br /><br />Special thanks to Caspar de Zinger for porting my Transparent Controls solution to VB.NET
