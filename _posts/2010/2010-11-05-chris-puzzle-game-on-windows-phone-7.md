I got my first application published on the Marketplace. The process was surprisingly fast, took overnight to get it certified and another day before it appeared on the Marketplace. I have a video demo of the game [here](/2010/10/chris-puzzle-game-for-windows-phone-7.html)Â and I demonstrate how parts of the game was built in an article called [Writing a Puzzle Game for Windows Phone 7 using XNA](/2010/09/writing-puzzle-game-for-windows-phone-7.html). Try the game out, I'd love to get some feedback. It's a game made over a weekend and the main purpose was to experience the publishing process. If you have some comments, suggestions, or questions on the game then please send them to me and I'll see what I can do.
