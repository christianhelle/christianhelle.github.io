Some time ago, I started a hobby project for generating data access layer code for SQL Compact Edition databases. I managed to get as far as creating a custom tool and generating a code behind data access layer file (currently only in C#) for every table in the database.<br /><br />I'm having a bit of a hard time finding the time to work on the project so I published it on CodePlex. If you're interested in the source code or if you want to contribute to the project then check it out at <a href="http://sqlcecodegen.codeplex.com/">http://sqlcecodegen.codeplex.com/</a>
