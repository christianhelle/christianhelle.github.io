The one thing that irritated me the most about the Windows Phone 7 emulator the first time I used it was that the host computer keyboard is not directly mapped to the emulator. This means you by default have to use the software input panel that is built in Windows Phone 7. <br /><br />I immediately looked for a solution and found some MSDN documentation on the keyboard mappings for the emulator.<br /><br />To enable the keyboard in the emulator - press the <span style="font-weight:bold;">PAGE UP</span> key or <span style="font-weight:bold;">PAUSE/BREAK</span> key.<br /><br />To disable the keyboard in the emulator - press the <span style="font-weight:bold;">PAGE DOWN</span> key <span style="font-weight:bold;">PAUSE/BREAK</span> key.<br /><br />If you want to learn more then I suggest you check out this article called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff754352.aspx">Keyboard Mapping for Windows Phone Emulator</a>
