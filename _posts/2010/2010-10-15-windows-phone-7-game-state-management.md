Not so long ago I wrote a Puzzle game for Windows Phone 7 using XNA. The game was really simple and had no menu or state management. Luckily, I recently stumbled upon a sample on MSDN that describes the basics of implementing game state management using XNA.  

To try things out a bit more I modified my existing puzzle game and included the sample game state management code. The results are pretty amazing!  

Here's how my Puzzle Game for Windows Phone 7 looks like now:

I described in detail how I built my puzzle game application in an article called [Writing a Puzzle Game for Windows Phone 7 using XNA](/2010/09/writing-puzzle-game-for-windows-phone-7.html). Try checking it out, I hope you find it interesting
