About a year ago, I had the chance to sit down with a brilliant developer with Muscular Atrophy. I was doing some mentoring that time and was helping them in solving some minor issues regarding a Windows Mobile based solution.<br /><br />Yesterday, while I was checking out what's new on MSDN's Channel 9 website I saw that the guys at Cepa Mobility were interviewed by Channel 9. These guys are doing some really great stuff for enabling people with disabilities.<br /><br />Here are some very interesting and inspiring videos of the guys and their work:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8stlsIN3tU&">YouTube - Mobile Communicator for People with Disabilities</a><br /><a href="mms://mschnlnine.wmod.llnwd.net/a1809/d1/ch9/0/IOCepaPart1_s_ch9.wmv">Channel 9 - Cepa Mobility: Enabling the Disabled with Mobile Communication</a><br /><a href="mms://mschnlnine.wmod.llnwd.net/a1809/d1/ch9/0/IOCepaDemo_s_ch9.wmv">Channel 9 - CepaCom Demo</a>
