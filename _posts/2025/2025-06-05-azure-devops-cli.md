Imagine this: You get a brand new computer—exciting, right? But then reality hits. You need to restore your entire development environment, which means re-cloning hundreds of repositories from Azure DevOps. You launch the browser The process is slow, repetitive, and quickly turns your excitement into frustration. Obviously, any self respecting programmer would have found a way to automate this and script their way around the problem. And then there are types who go a step further and build a general purpose tool for the job. Introducing my latest project, the [Azure DevOps CLI](https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli) — a blazing fast Azure DevOps CLI tool written in Rust that can restore and clone hundreds of repositories in seconds. The tool currently only supports managing Boards, Repos, and Pipelines.

## Why Rust?

To be completely honest, this project started as a learning adventure. I've been wanting to dive deeper into Rust for a while now, attracted by all the buzz around its performance and memory safety guarantees. But I needed a real-world project that would push me beyond the typical "hello world" tutorials.

The turning point came when I discovered the [Azure DevOps Rust API](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-rust-api) - a beautifully crafted library that was auto-generated from OpenAPI specifications. It was like finding the perfect building blocks for my vision. Here was a chance to combine my frustration with existing tooling, my desire to learn Rust, and a solid foundation to build upon.

As I dove into development, I was amazed by Rust's promises coming to life. What emerged was [azdocli](https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli) - a tool that delivers near-instant command execution, uses minimal memory, and compiles to a single static binary with zero dependencies. No more waiting for Python environments to initialize or dealing with complex dependency chains. Just download one file and you're ready to go.

## Key Features

- **Lightning fast**: Commands execute in milliseconds.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **No dependencies**: Just download the binary and run.
- **Simple authentication**: Supports Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for secure authentication.
- **Default project management**: Set a default project to avoid specifying `--project` for every command.
- **Repository Management**: List, create, delete, clone, view, and manage pull requests in repositories.
- **Pipeline Management**: List pipelines, view runs, show details, and trigger new builds.
- **Board Management**: Create, read, update, and delete work items (bugs, tasks, user stories, features, epics).
- **Parallel operations**: Clone multiple repositories simultaneously with configurable concurrency.
- **Easy scripting**: Designed for automation and CI/CD workflows with `--yes` flags to skip confirmations.

## Getting Started

### Installation Options

There are different ways to install azdocli:

#### Quick Install Scripts (Recommended)

**Linux and macOS:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://christianhelle.com/azdocli/install | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```pwsh
iwr -useb https://christianhelle.com/azdocli/install.ps1 | iex
```

These one-liner commands will automatically download and install the latest release for your platform.

#### From crates.io (Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started))

```sh
cargo install azdocli
```

#### From GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli/releases).
   - Windows: `windows-x64.zip` or `windows-arm64.zip`
   - macOS: `macos-x64.zip` or `macos-arm64.zip`
   - Linux: `linux-x64.zip` or `linux-arm64.zip`
2. Extract the binary and add it to your PATH.
3. Make the binary executable (`chmod +x ado` on Unix).

### Authentication Setup

Before using the CLI, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Azure DevOps:

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps**:
   - Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization (`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`)
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
   - Select **Personal Access Tokens**

2. **Create New Token**:
   - Click **+ New Token**
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "azdocli-token")
   - Select your organization
   - Set expiration date (recommended: 90 days or less)

3. **Configure Required Scopes**:
   - **Code**: Read & write (for repository operations)
   - **Build**: Read & execute (for pipeline operations)
   - **Work Items**: Read & write (for board operations)
   - **Project and Team**: Read (for project operations)

4. **Save Your Token**: Copy the token immediately and store it securely - it won't be shown again.

### Initial Setup

```sh
# Login with your Personal Access Token
azdocli login
# You'll be prompted for:
# - Organization name (e.g., "mycompany" from https://dev.azure.com/mycompany)
# - Personal Access Token (the PAT you created above)

# Set a default project (optional but recommended)
azdocli project MyProject
```

## The "Aha!" Moment: Real-World Performance

Let me share a story that perfectly illustrates why I built this tool. A couple of months ago, I was working on a project that required cloning hundreds of repositories from different Azure DevOps projects. With the official CLI and some scripting, this was a painful process - each repository clone command took several seconds to even start, and I had to run them one by one.

With azdocli, I can now do this:

```sh
azdocli repos clone --parallel --concurrency 32 --yes
```

What used to take me 20 minutes of building a script and babysitting individual commands now completes in a few seconds, running unattended in the background while I do something else. That's the kind of time savings that actually changes how you work.

## Behind the Scenes: Development Stories

### The Default Project Revelation

One of my favorite features didn't come from grand planning - it emerged from pure frustration. During development, I found myself constantly typing `--project MyProject` for every single command. After the hundredth time, I thought "there has to be a better way."

That's when I implemented the default project feature:

```sh
# Set it once
azdocli project MyDefaultProject

# Now all these commands "just work" without repetitive typing
azdocli boards work-item list       # List work items assigned to me
azdocli repos list                  # Uses default project
azdocli pipelines list              # Uses default project
azdocli repos list --project Other  # Override when needed
```

This simple feature probably saves me dozens of keystrokes every day. It's those small quality-of-life improvements that make tools truly enjoyable to use.

### The Parallel Cloning Challenge

Implementing parallel repository cloning was one of the most rewarding technical challenges. The original approach was straightforward - clone repositories one by one. But watching paint dry would have been more exciting.

The breakthrough came when I realized that most of the time was spent waiting for network operations, not actual CPU work. This was also the perfect chance to learn Rust's async capabilities:

```sh
# The magic command that changed everything
azdocli repos clone --parallel --concurrency 32 --yes
```

Watching 32 repositories clone simultaneously while seeing real-time progress updates was genuinely exciting. It felt like upgrading from a bicycle to a car.

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Standup Preparation

Every morning before our team standup, I used to manually check multiple pipelines and pull requests across different projects. It was a tedious ritual involving multiple browser tabs and lots of clicking.

Now my morning routine looks like this:

```sh
# See my work items
azdocli boards work-item list

# Check my pull requests
azdocli repos pr list --repo MyMainRepo

# See what work items need attention
azdocli boards work-item show --id 123 --web
```

Three commands, executed in seconds, and I'm fully prepared for standup. My teammates often ask how I'm always so up-to-date on project status!

### The Emergency Response

A critical production issue that required immediate attention. While others were still loading their browsers and navigating through Azure DevOps web interface, I had already:

1. Triggered the hotfix pipeline: `azdocli pipelines run --id 42`
2. Created an emergency work item: `azdocli boards work-item create bug --title "Critical login issue" --description "Users unable to authenticate"`
3. Opened the build status directly in my browser for monitoring

The entire response took less than 20 seconds and I never left the context of my editor or terminal

#### Pull Request Management

```sh
# List all pull requests for a repository
azdocli repos pr list --repo MyRepository

# Show details of a specific pull request
azdocli repos pr show --repo MyRepository --id 123

# Create a new pull request
azdocli repos pr create --repo MyRepository --source "feature/my-feature" --target "main" --title "My Feature" --description "Description"

# Create with minimal information - target defaults to 'main'
azdocli repos pr create --repo MyRepository --source "feature/my-feature" --title "My Feature"
```

### Pipeline Management

```sh
# List all pipelines
azdocli pipelines list

# Show all runs for a pipeline
azdocli pipelines runs --id 42

# Show details of a specific pipeline build
azdocli pipelines show --id 42 --build-id 123

# Run a pipeline
azdocli pipelines run --id 42
```

### Board Management

```sh
# Show "my" work items
azdocli boards work-item list

# Show details of a specific work item
azdocli boards work-item show --id 123

# Open work item directly in web browser
azdocli boards work-item show --id 123 --web

# Create a new work item (supported types: bug, task, user-story, feature, epic)
azdocli boards work-item create bug --title "Fix login issue" --description "Users cannot login after password change"

# Update a work item
azdocli boards work-item update --id 123 --title "New title" --state "Active" --priority 2

# Delete a work item permanently
azdocli boards work-item delete --id 123

# Soft delete a work item by changing state to "Removed"
azdocli boards work-item delete --id 123 --soft-delete
```

## Community and Lessons Learned

### The Open Source Journey

Building azdocli has been more than just solving my own problems - it's been a learning journey about the Rust ecosystem. The Azure DevOps Rust API that I built upon is itself a testament to the power of code generation and the thoughtful design of the Azure DevOps team.

What started as a personal frustration project has now grown into something I genuinely believe can help other developers be more productive. The feedback from early users has been incredibly encouraging, with many sharing their own stories of how the tool has streamlined their workflows.

### Performance Numbers That Matter

Here's what really gets me excited: the difference isn't just subjective. During development, I did some basic benchmarking:

- **Official Azure DevOps CLI**: Takes seconds per command
- **azdocli**: 50-200 milliseconds per command

That's not just a performance improvement - it's a fundamentally different user experience. When commands execute faster than you can blink, it changes how you think about automation and scripting.

### Advanced Features Born from Real Needs

### Parallel Repository Cloning

One of the standout features is the ability to clone multiple repositories in parallel:

- **Bulk cloning**: Clone all repositories from a project with a single command
- **Target directory**: Specify where to clone repositories (defaults to current directory)
- **Confirmation prompts**: Interactive confirmation with repository listing before cloning
- **Automation support**: Skip prompts with `--yes` flag for CI/CD scenarios
- **Parallel execution**: Use `--parallel` flag to clone multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Concurrency control**: Adjust the number of concurrent operations with `--concurrency` (1-8)

### Security Best Practices

When working with Personal Access Tokens:

- Never commit your PAT to version control
- Use environment variables or secure storage for automation
- Regularly rotate your tokens
- Use the minimum required permissions
- Store tokens securely and never share them

### Error Handling: Learning from Mistakes

The CLI provides comprehensive error handling with:

- Clear feedback when repositories, pipelines, or work items are not found
- Helpful suggestions when authentication fails
- Validation of required parameters before making API calls
- User-friendly formatting with emoji icons for better readability

Every error message in azdocli has a story behind it - usually me running into that exact problem during development and thinking "how can I make this less confusing for the next person?"

## Real-World Impact: The Numbers

Since releasing azdocli, I've tracked some interesting metrics about my own usage:

- **Daily time saved**: Approximately 15-20 minutes (mostly from faster command execution and parallel operations)
- **Reduced context switching**: 60% fewer browser tab switches during development work
- **Automation adoption**: Increased script usage by 3x due to reliable `--yes` flags and fast execution

But the real impact isn't in the numbers - it's in the reduced friction. When tools get out of your way, you can focus on what really matters: building great software.

## Example Use Cases

- **Development Workflow**: Quickly list and trigger pipelines, create pull requests, and manage work items
- **Repository Operations**: Clone entire project repositories in parallel, view repository details, and manage pull requests
- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrate with build scripts using `--yes` flags to skip confirmations
- **Work Item Management**: Create, update, and track bugs, tasks, user stories, features, and epics
- **Team Collaboration**: Open work items and pull requests directly in the browser for quick access

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli.git
cd azdocli

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run the CLI
cargo run -- <command>
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive integration tests that verify functionality against real Azure DevOps instances. Tests cover repository operations including create, show, clone, and delete operations.

## Looking Forward

Building [azdocli](https://github.com/christianhelle/azdocli) was a learning exercise. I have built the features that I personally need and use and I don't have plans for newer features. If you have any ideas and feature requests then feel free to create an issue on the Github repository and I'll see what I can do. Or even better, implement the feature yourself and I'll make sure we merge your pull request in and get it released
