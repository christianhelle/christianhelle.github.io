<div>I recently received a Samsung Omnia 7 and I think it's a pretty awesome phone. But, Windows Phone 7 in general lags behind with a few things, one of these things is a built in internet tethering feature (like in the iPhone for example). Since I'm going away for a few days I don't intend on going around with a 3G modem (my laptop doesn't have a built in 3G modem), neither am I to keen on switching back to my iPhone. So I searched for a solution and stumbled upon a hack to enable launch the Omnia 7 Diagnostic Menu and the Micro USB Test.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's what you need to do</div><div><ul><li>Open the phone application</li><li>Dial &nbsp;<b># # 634 #</b> and press Call</li><li>This will launch the diagnostic menu</li><li>Enter &nbsp;<b>* # 7284 #</b></li><li>If the code above is entered properly then the Micro USB Test app launches&nbsp;</li><li>Select <b>Modem, Tethered Call</b></li><li>You are prompted to restart the device</li><li>Connect your Omnia 7 to your computer via USB</li></ul>In my attempt I was prompted to install the Samsung USB Driver and Windows 7 provided me with a link. Try it out :)</div><div><br /></div>
