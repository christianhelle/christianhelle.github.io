I recently discovered a new book called .NET Compact Framework 3.5 Data Driven Applications. I've so far only read a few chapters but it seems like a promising book providing a lot of examples.<br /><br />Here's a downloadable free chapter :<br /><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/data-driven-applications-with-.net-compact-framework-3-5/book?utm_source=christian-helle.blogspot.com&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003787">http://www.packtpub.com/data-driven-applications-with-.net-compact-framework-3-5/book?utm_source=christian-helle.blogspot.com&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003787</a><br /><br />I plan to write a detailed review of the book once I'm done reading it
