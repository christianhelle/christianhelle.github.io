It's been pretty interesting these past days where I've been hanging out at the Microsoft Dynamics Convergence 2007 Conference in Copenhagen. I had a chance to speak as a guest speaker for a session called "MOB102:  Extending Your Microsoft Dynamics Solution Through Mobile Applications".<br /><br />I also had the chance to show a demo of a new product that I have been working on lately. A Time, Material, and Mileage registration application called the TimeTracker. One of the key features that the crowd really loved was the one handed navigation or thumb navigation design. Of course the graphics, performance, and the integration with Microsoft Dynamics NAV was also a huge hit.<br /><br />The last day of the conference is tomorrow and I'm looking forward to what tomorrow has to offer
