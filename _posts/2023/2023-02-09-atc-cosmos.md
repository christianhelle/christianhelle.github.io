A couple of years ago, me and a group of colleagues and friends, decided that we should open source the ideas, concepts, design patterns, and libraries that we have been carrying around from project to project. From this idea, [ATC.NET](https://github.com/atc-net) was born. We had to come up with a name for this project, which in turn became a Github Organization with by this time of writing has [40 members](https://github.com/orgs/atc-net/people), 28 [active repositories](https://github.com/orgs/atc-net/repositories), 1.8 million [total package downloads from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/atc-net), and 70k monthly [downloads from PyPi](https://pypistats.org/packages/atc-dataplatform)
